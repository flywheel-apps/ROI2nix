# ROI2nix

Converts ROIs created in the Flwwheel OHIF viewer to NIfTI files.

## Usage Notes

The gear will process the ROIs from a source image into a NIfTI file. If no ROIs are present, the gear will notify and exit without producing any output.

Default output is all single ROIs as binary masks and a comma-separated-value (csv) file with

`<roi_label>, <roi_index>, <roi_voxels>, <roi_volume (mm^3)>`

for each ROI. The ROI volumes are generated by multiplying the total number of voxels by the determinant of the 3x3 submatrix of the affine.

Additional output can be:

* The combined ROIs in a bitmasked (sum of powers of two) NIfTI file.
* A 3D Slicer colortable file.

### inputs

* Input_File (required): The NIfTI file with ROIs created in the OHIF viewer

### parameters

* binary_masks: Saves individually labeled ROIs as binary masks. Default is On.
* combine_output: Saves all ROIs in a single bitmasked file. If less than 2 ROIs exists, then this has no effect.
* slicer_color_table: Saves a 3D Slicer colortable file for integration.
